We used ALS in Spark to generate a baseline model.   

This model provided a RMSE of .81 on the training data.  
It reconstructed the predictions based on 10 latent features. 

I explored the top 3 latent features in relation to both users and movies. I was hoping to find some clear topics that would help us better interpret the model.
