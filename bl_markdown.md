We used ALS in Spark to generate a baseline model.   

This model provided a RMSE of .81 on the training data.  
It reconstructed the predictions based on 10 latent features. 

I explored the top 3 latent features in relation to both users and movies. I was hoping to find some clear topics that would help us better interpret the model.  When reviewing the most important latent feature from both groups. It was not immediately clear what binds this group together
