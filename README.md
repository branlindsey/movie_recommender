### Latent Dirichlet Allocation

***What is LDA?***

[Intuitive Guide to Latent Dirichlet Allocation](https://towardsdatascience.com/light-on-math-machine-learning-intuitive-guide-to-latent-dirichlet-allocation-437c81220158)

</br>

Topic modelling refers to the task of identifying topics that best describes a set of documents. These topics will only emerge during the topic modelling process (therefore called latent). And one popular topic modelling technique is known as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Though the name is a mouthful, the concept behind this is very simple.

</br>

To tell briefly, LDA imagines a fixed set of topics. Each topic represents a set of words. And the goal of LDA is to map all the documents to the topics in a way, such that the words in each document are mostly captured by those imaginary topics.

*Each document can be described by a distribution of topics and each topic can be described by a distribution of words*

#### Baseline Count Vectorized LDA:

Using a CountVectorizer, a baseline model was created, producing these results.

```
Topics found via LDA:

Topic #0:
expletive_0 love uh expletive_1 woo expletive_6 baby man money expletive_3 skrrt drop thun cardi bad

Topic #1:
expletive_3 expletive_1 expletive_0 expletive_4 baby love right cause time say god real tell want better

Topic #2:
gang gucci watch lil wicked drake cut love west kanye bust expletive_3 bop expletive_1 young
```
<details>
  <summary>
    More Topics
  </summary>

```
Topic #3:
hitta hittas love lil 2016 money black expletive_3 young ring saying rake world rich mask

Topic #4:
expletive_0 expletive_1 walk expletive_3 want love nothin talk money bout feel ball bank taste young

Topic #5:
expletive_0 expletive_3 expletive_4 hol really expletive_1 look want man em say cause money keys feel

Topic #6:
expletive_0 expletive_1 expletive_3 baby want expletive_4 hit love pop right expletive_2 ta girl cause money
```

</details>

#### Final Count Vectorized LDA:

Noticing that there were a lot of noise that was generated by the replaced expletives, they were removed along with other rap specific stop_words that seemed to add nothing to our intepretation of the topics.

```
Topics found via LDA:

Topic #0:
walk talk gotta lot times want twerk dance bandz love break lil tell cabello moves good time man hit came

Topic #1:
feel thun drop stoner time type wanna want love tell good plug say wait man cause look girl hate face

Topic #2:
gang watch gucci cut cardi whip hot bop nae brr wrist kitchen 21 stir cartier fry huh chain woo nah
```
<details>
  <summary>
    More Topics
  </summary>

```
Topic #3:
dog maybe jesus beat say ride huh tried tryna want wanna leave cause baby skrrt time feed run gotta came

Topic #4:

nothin money hit really bout jumpman quan worried bank lil big say woo cause new em low rap somethin boy

Topic #10:
want pop uh problem stop love bad right say em feelin look money tryna mind rollie good red young girl
```

#### Baseline TF-IDF LDA:

We then looked into using TF-IDF to use with the LDA Model.

# K O D A K  B O T  3 0 0 0

#### Scrape Lyrics

In order to get started in making the ***K O D A K  B O T  3 0 0 0***, I used the [GENIUS API](https://docs.genius.com/), as well as a library [LyricsGenius](https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius) that helps in scraping the data. 

<p>
  <img align="right" src="https://gifimage.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kodak-black-gif-6.gif"></img>
</p>

```python
# Set Target Artist
trg_artist = 'Kodak Black'
# Create API Instance
api = genius.Genius(client_token)
# Search Artist Information
artist = api.search_artist(trg_artist)
```

When scraping for all of Kodak's songs, we ended up with a total of 267 songs, the sample data in table below is truncated.

NUM            | SONG | 
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
Song 1 | "Tunnel Vision"
Song 2 | "No Flockin"
Song 3 | "Roll in Peace"
Song 4 | "ZEZE"
Song 5 | "SKRT"


#### Lyric Format

After scraping the lyrics, we now have to access the JSON data and pull out the individual lyrics per song, let's take a look at the structuing of the JSON file.

<p >

```python
# Save Lyrics from Artist
aux = artist.save_lyrics(filename='lyrics.json', overwrite=True, verbose=True)
```

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boogiedev/HITMAKA-3000/master/media/kodakscrape.PNG" width='80%'></img>
</p>

#### Cleaning 

Sample of pre-clean tokens from NLTK *word_tokenize* function
```python
['glee', 'southside', 'ayy', ',', 'lil', 'metro', 'beat', 'lil', 'kodak', ',', 'dont', 'like', 
'see', 'winnin', 'wan', 'na', 'see', 'penitentiary', 'need', 'lil', 'baby', 'gon', 'listen',
'girl', ',', 'dont', 'wan', 'na', 'one', 'iggin']
```
It seems like with the NLTK module, some of the slang and informal spelling of words become chopped up... looks like we have to make our own tokenizer!

```python
['glee', 'southside', 'ayy', 'lil', 'metro', 'on', 'that', 'beat', 'lil', 'kodak', 'they', 'dont', 'like', 
'to', 'see', 'you', 'winnin', 'they', 'wanna', 'see', 'you', 'in', 'the', 'penitentiary', 'i', 'need', 'me', 
'a', 'lil', 'baby', 'who', 'gon', 'listen', 'girl', 'i', 'dont', 'wanna', 'be', 'the', 'one', 'you', 'iggin']
```

This looks so much better!

### RAP Generation via RNN

```python
%tensorflow_version 1.x

from google.colab import files
from textgenrnn import textgenrnn
from datetime import datetime
import os

textgen.train_from_file('kodak_lyrics.txt', num_epochs=20)
```

#### Epoch 1
```
Epoch 1/20
5008/5008 [==============================] - 64s 13ms/step - loss: 1.3509
####################
Temperature: 0.2
####################
i dont want no more but i aint got no more baby

i got this **** in the street (yeah)

i was still a lil ****** when i got the streets

####################
```

#### Epoch 20 @ Different Temperature Hyperparameters
```
Epoch 20/20
5008/5008 [==============================] - 61s 12ms/step - loss: 0.9543
```

### Performance and Manual Sentiment Analysis

Sample Output BARs| Thoughts
:--: | :--: |
im so fed up i dont even chase the same | Aligns with message, sounds like him
i fell in love with the pole, i be rollin in the open | Sounds like he is in a club
i be so drive it in my feet, i just wanna ride candy | ...?

***We had to stop because the KODAKBOT started becoming self aware, so we ceased to push this endeavour in order to protect humanity (and the rap scene).*** 

***HE'S TOO EVOLVED, 
HIS MOVEMENTS ARE TOO FAST, 
HIS LYRICALITY IS INSANE***
